      Dr. Burke's Responses (NOTES TAKEN IN GREEN)
    </p>
  </center>

    <p>Do you consent to your answers or name being used in presentations or conversations about our topic?</p>
    <p style="color:green">Yes</p>

    <p>How long have you been teaching technology or Computer Science?</p>
    <p style="color:green">5 years in public schools, taught graduate courses and undergraduates previously for a few years. Instructor for 10 years. Informally many years.</p>

    <p>Do you have prior experience inside  of computer science or technology before you started teaching?</p>
    <p style="color:green">Yes. Decades as a software developer/engineer in the private sector, then at a university.</p>

    <p>What are some topics of technology you enjoy teaching about? (Ie robotics, software development, game creation, computer engineering)</p>
    <p style="color:green">Programming,  Cybersecurity, Game Creation. Never taught robotics, but interesting. Anything in computer science.</p>

    <p>What are the hardest topics for your students to learn in technology classes? What is the easiest?</p>
    <p style="color:green">Hardest is that Programming requires problem solving, new ways of computational thinking. Using computers is easiest.</p>

    <p>What are some technology or computer science topics, if any, that you would like to teach, but are not currently taught?</p>
    <p style="color:green">AI, but little is personally known, though most known about AI in the school. “Bridge” between technician and educator. Machine learning.</p>

    <p>In a modern society, we are now surrounded by high technology, like smartphones, computers, even some whiteboards in the district are now electronic. Do you think that a modern society like what we live in would benefit from a greater focus on technology and computer science education than what is currently available?</p>
    <p style="color:green">Yes, Students should become creators of technology at every level of used technology by themselves and the community. Most opportunities for skills applied. Students should become creators to solve society's problems, with new tools. This includes diversity, for more problems to be solved. Teach not to use technology but to create technology. TV media/Graphics are not just using technology, but creating technological artifacts and products.</p>

    <p>What resources do you like to use in your teaching for technology?(Ie. codecademy, scratch)</p>
    <p style="color:green">Scratch, Codecademy, MIT app inventor, Adobe Suite, PLTW platform, Replit, VEX Robotics. Not his classes, but robotics uses neuro(?) Hand robotics, and “Lego Spike”. Educational technology is always advancing, connected to other subjects.</p>

    <p>What do you think are topics you can see being taught in technology classes maybe 5 or 10 years from now?</p>
    <p style="color:green">AI/Machine Learning, Cross-disciplinary work(data science, biomedical technology)</p>

    <p>What do you think the consequences of an expanded computer science and technology focus in schools would be?</p>
    <p style="color:green">If a “pathway” is formed, potential partnerships with universities and higher ed, internships, applied use of learning. Can really only happen if teaching relevant materials, and partnerships with local resources. A program of computer science teachers can guarantee sustained partnerships with local resources. Dr. Brelsford wants more partnerships with local resources.</p>
