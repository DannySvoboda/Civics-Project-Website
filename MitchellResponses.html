    </p>
  </center>

    <p>Do you consent to your answers or name being used in presentations or conversations about our topic?</p>
    <p style="color:green">Yes</p>

    <p>How long have you been teaching technology or Computer Science?</p>
    <p style="color:green">30 Years, taught at westport, fall river, chace and south elementary, as well as north in 2020.</p>

    <p>Do you have prior experience inside  of computer science or technology before you started teaching?</p>
    <p style="color:green">No, worked in a non-technical role at a phone company before teaching.</p>

    <p>What are some topics of technology you enjoy teaching about? (Ie robotics, software development, game creation, computer engineering)</p>
    <p style="color:green">Google Apps, Digital Citizenship, Hour of Code, Scratch, Robots(“Dash”, “Andy”)</p>

    <p>What are the hardest topics for your students to learn in technology classes? What is the easiest?</p>
    <p style="color:green">Programming is the hardest, Using Apps is the easiest. There is no app creation taught, only usage of apps.</p>

    <p>What are some technology or computer science topics, if any, that you would like to teach, but are not currently taught?</p>
    <p style="color:green">They follow the state curriculum, with a basic grade level. Blocks based coding, not text based. The tech classes only meet for 40 mins once a week.</p>

    <p>In a modern society, we are now surrounded by high technology, like smartphones, computers, even some whiteboards in the district are now electronic. Do you think that a modern society like what we live in would benefit from a greater focus on technology and computer science education than what is currently available?</p>
    <p style="color:green">Yes, Education is moving towards STEM and Tech. The certification for tech classes is in Digital Literacy and Computer Science. There is not a large push in elementary for greater tech focus.</p>

    <p>What resources do you like to use in your teaching for technology? (Ie. codecademy, scratch)</p>
    <p style="color:green">Google apps, Code.org(leaned heavily), Kodables, Code Monkey Jr, Tynker, Scratch, more resources could be used if they were given more time.</p>

    <p>What do you think are topics you can see being taught in technology classes maybe 5 or 10 years from now?</p>
    <p style="color:green">AI could find a way to be used, Text based could potentially be explored, Touchscreen and interactive tech also could become prevalent.</p>

    <p>What do you think the consequences of an expanded computer science and technology focus in schools would be?</p>
    <p style="color:green">Kids could have more readiness for careers. Supports Dr. Burke’s Idea of a pathway, thinks it would be beneficial. “Chris Green” is the Vice Principal, and head of Tech at Chace. A pathway concept has been discussed before with Mr. Medeiros and Mr. Falcon of SMS. </p>
