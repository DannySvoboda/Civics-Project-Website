    </p>
  </center>

    <p>Do you consent to your answers or name being used in presentations or conversations about our topic?</p>
    <p style="color:green">Yes</p>

    <p>How long have you been teaching technology or Computer Science?</p>
    <p style="color:green">13-14 years</p>

    <p>Do you have prior experience inside  of computer science or technology before you started teaching?</p>
    <p style="color:green">Raytheon, ADTech,worked on patriot missile tracker,SQQ-32(Mine-detector),Onboard computer audio</p>

    <p>What are some topics of technology you enjoy teaching about? (Ie robotics, software development, game creation, computer engineering)</p>
    <p style="color:green"> Design process, Robotics, Circuit theory, programming. Don't have enough time for text based coding</p>

    <p>What are the hardest topics for your students to learn in technology classes? What is the easiest?</p>
    <p style="color:green">Hardest: High School: AC->DC, 
    Blocks based -> text based, robotics is hard to teach because; mechanical v software</p>
    <p style = "color:green"> Easiest: CO2 Dragsters, makes sense, Soldering @ high school level.</p>


    <p>What are some technology or computer science topics, if any, that you would like to teach, but are not currently taught?</p>
    <p style="color:green">More in conditionals/control loops (nesting). Web Design.</p>

    <p>In a modern society, we are now surrounded by high technology, like smartphones, computers, even some whiteboards in the district are now electronic. Do you think that a modern society like what we live in would benefit from a greater focus on technology and computer science education than what is currently available?</p>
    <p style="color:green">Yes and no, Supports a focus, but needs to emphasize fundamentals as well. Less distance from the “how”. More control from the person. </p>

    <p>What resources do you like to use in your teaching for technology? 
    (Ie. codecademy, scratch)</p>
    <p style="color:green">Tynker(because covid), Youtube videos, Lego Sumo Wrestling, Some python. 2/6 days in a cycle for 50-55 mins</p>

    <p>What do you think are topics you can see being taught in technology classes maybe 5 or 10 years from now?</p>
    <p style="color:green">AI, Quantum Computing, Electric Vehicles(if supported infrastructure), Auto Driving</p>

    <p>What do you think the consequences of an expanded computer science and technology focus in schools would be?</p>
    <p style="color:green">“Getting kids attention” with a laid out plot. Budgetary concerns because tech is ever changing. Supports a pathway, vocational style internships.</p>
