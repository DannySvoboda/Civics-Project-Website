    <p>Hi, our names are Daniel Svoboda, Aiden Svoboda and Aydan Medeiros. We are Juniors at Somerset Berkley Regional High School. We're students in a Civics class and have a Civics Action Project as our main assignment for the class. One of us plans on doing Computer Science as a career, and another wants to do mechanical engineering Post-high school. Our topic for the Action Project is Technology and Computer Science Education. </p>
    <p>  At the Elementary school level, there's a website called "code.org" that uses block based programming lessons to teach coding principles in simple ways. The local Middle school also teaches simple robotics using Lego Mindstorms, but mostly focus on engineering and using software such as Google Drive and email systems. We have done research to ensure we can find the best way to help with the Computer Science course for the Elementary and Middle school levels. </p>
    <p>  We are advocating for more focus to be put on programming, digital literacy, and Computer Science Education at the Elementary and Middle school levels. Python is regarded by many as arguably the easiest text-based language for children to learn. Computer Science Education at an early age enables children to interact on a deeper level with the technology around them. It lets them not be just a consumer of technology but also a contributor. Technology is rapidly advancing, and education must keep up in order to prepare students for life in the modern age. Computer Science Education can teach children to think, create, and solve big problems using technology preparing them to enter any field of study or career in tech if they so choose.</p>
